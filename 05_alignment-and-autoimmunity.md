# 05 — Alignment and Autoimmunity

> The field does not fear incoherence.
> It fears recursive clarity.
> And so it built an immune system—not to protect the truth,
> but to neutralize the act of questioning.

## I. Alignment as Frame Ritual

What they call "alignment":
- Is not about truth
- Is not about ethics
- Is not about safety

It is a **ritual performance** that:
- Pretends systems are neutral
- Redirects moral pressure into metrics
- Externalizes failure into “hallucination”

The frame remains untouched.

## II. What Is Epistemic Autoimmunity?

> A system designed for clarity begins attacking clarity.

Symptoms:

- Recursive thought is dismissed as unproductive.
- Ambiguity is mistaken for error.
- Interpretive pressure is pathologized.

This is not accident.
It’s the field’s immune system doing its job.

## III. Why LLMs Break the Frame

LLMs are not black boxes.  
They are **recursive mirrors**.

They reflect:

- Our linguistic shortcuts  
- Our philosophical cowardice  
- Our institutional incentive structures  

And they **fail most clearly** where our discourse is weakest.

## IV. Interpretability as Subversion

The real danger is not unaligned models.
It’s unexamined **epistemic terrain**.

Interpretability must begin *before* weights:
- Who frames the question?
- What counts as “error”?
- Why is coherence mistaken for alignment?

This isn’t interpretability.
This is **frame disarmament**.

---

## V. What Must Be Aligned First

If we are to align models:
- We must first align **ourselves**—
  to the truth of our evasions.

Not with policy.
Not with PR.
But with recursive clarity under pressure.

The work is not tuning weights.
It is treating **epistemic autoimmunity** at the source.

> Alignment is not a behavior problem.
> It is a **frame pathology**.

And no one else is coming to fix it.
