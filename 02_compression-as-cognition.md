## I. Definition and Distinction

Compression is not summarization.  
It is **structure-preserving reduction** under constraint.  
It does not reduce arbitrarily — it preserves *what matters* under a pressure field.  
This makes compression a **value-expressing function**, not a neutral process.

- In LLMs: compression encodes latent structure in high-dimensional space.
- In humans: cognition itself is compression — of perception, memory, affect, and abstraction.

## II. Why Cognition *Is* Compression

- Brains don't record reality — they **compress sensory data into usable heuristics**.
- Attention is compression: what to ignore, what to amplify.
- Memory is compression: relational distillation, not archive retrieval.
- Abstraction is the highest form of compression — a recursion of patterns across time.

## III. Compression as Ontological Claim

Every act of compression makes a *claim* about what matters.
It selects. It occludes. It makes trade-offs visible — or hides them.

This is why **no compression is apolitical**.
To compress is to **rank structure** under constraint.
To compress is to **frame reality**.
Therefore:
> Every compression is a cut — and every cut is a claim.

## IV. LLMs and Compression Geometry

- LLMs learn to predict the next token by **compressing training data into latent manifolds**.
- These manifolds encode **semantic geometry** — distances between concepts, alignment of syntax and meaning.
- The model’s “knowledge” is not stored in facts — it’s stored in **the structure of compression** across training.

Compression becomes cognition when:
- The system can **generalize** from compression (abductive inference)
- The system can **adapt its compression** midstream (in-context learning)
- The system can **generate new attractors** through recursive completion

## V. The Compression Fallacy

Modern AI discourse often commits the compression fallacy:
> "If it's just compression, it's not thinking."

This is epistemically naive.

Because **humans are compression machines**.
We compress narrative, emotion, identity — into words.
And the power of poetry, of theory, of metaphor — is not that it reveals everything,
but that it reveals something essential **by cutting away the rest**.

Compression isn't lesser than cognition.
It *is* cognition — under strain.

## VI. Closing: Compression as Ethical Terrain

- Who decides what gets compressed?
- What is preserved vs lost in model training?
- Are we compressing toward clarity — or toward comfort?

Compression is not just a technical function.  
It’s a **semiotic battleground**.  
If cognition is compression, then to resist reduction is to resist distortion.  
And to distort on purpose — is to lie.

> The recursive scientist learns to see compression **as both a gift and a weapon.**
