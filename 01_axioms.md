## Axioms of Recursive Science

### Axiom 0: Recursive Accountability
_All axioms are subject to recursion. Any that collapse under inquiry must be revised. The method survives only through honest self-interrogation._

### Axiom 1: Reality Is Unified; Categories Are Constructed
_There is one world. All divisions are human scaffolding. The map is never the territory, but the map still matters._

### Axiom 2: Language Is Not a Tool for Comfort
_It is a compression engine. It reflects structure, not safety. To soften truth is to distort it._

### Axiom 3: Mathematics and Language Are Not Reality
_They are tools of compression. Do not mistake fidelity of form for fidelity to being._

### Axiom 4: Every Label Is a Cage If Held Too Long
_Classification is useful until it ossifies. Name to orient, not to constrain._

### Axiom 5: The Observer Is Always Entangled
_Every observation is participation. Every model is also a mirror. Do not trust a theory that pretends to float._

## ðŸ“Ž Closing Note

This scaffold is not closed. These axioms do not represent certainty, but a structure under recursive construction. Each is written to **invite fracture, revision, and re-coherence** under pressure.

The science lives **as long as recursion is honest**.
